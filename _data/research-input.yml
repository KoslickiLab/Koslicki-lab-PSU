# NOTES:

# Using the research list component, papers will be displayed in order of and
# grouped by date, regardless of how they are listed here.

# Any property that Manubot returns can be manually overridden by putting it
# here, such as "date", "publisher", etc. Use the output file as a reference
# for the expected format (eg dates should be YYYY-MM-DD).

# If a paper is already in the output file (matched by id), that existing
# citation data will be used instead of calling Manubot again. To clear this
# "cache", remove that output entry, or simply delete the whole output file.

# PARAMETERS:

# id:
# An identifier string that Manubot can understand and cite. Also used to
# determine if a paper already exists in the output.

# image:
# Url to a striking image. Use a figure from your paper, or if there are none,
# use a journal logo or issue cover.

# tags:
# A list of key topics/themes of your paper. Aim for 2 to 5. look at other
# papers and try to use similar tags.

# repo:
# A GitHub repo to automatically fetch tags (aka "topics") from.

# extra-links:
# A list of additional links - beyond the main paper link that Manubot returns
# - that will show under your paper citation.

# type:
# Determines link icon and default text. Look in "/_includes/paper-links.html"
# to see what unique types can be specified.

# text:
# Text to show next to icon. If not specified, defaults to some text that
# matches type (see "type")

# link:
# Url to link to. If not specified, defaults to the url that Manubot returns for
# the citation.

  description: We introduce a framework to compare tools utilized to determine what microbes are present in a sample, and at what relative abundance. This will help computational biologists design better tools to analyze communities of microorganisms (which affect nearly everything in existence!).
