# NOTES:

# Using the research list component, papers will be displayed in order of and
# grouped by date, regardless of how they are listed here.

# Any property that Manubot returns can be manually overridden by putting it
# here, such as "date", "publisher", etc. Use the output file as a reference
# for the expected format (eg dates should be YYYY-MM-DD).

# If a paper is already in the output file (matched by id), that existing
# citation data will be used instead of calling Manubot again. To clear this
# "cache", remove that output entry, or simply delete the whole output file.

# PARAMETERS:

# id:
# An identifier string that Manubot can understand and cite. Also used to
# determine if a paper already exists in the output.

# image:
# Url to a striking image. Use a figure from your paper, or if there are none,
# use a journal logo or issue cover.

# tags:
# A list of key topics/themes of your paper. Aim for 2 to 5. look at other
# papers and try to use similar tags.

# repo:
# A GitHub repo to automatically fetch tags (aka "topics") from.

# extra-links:
# A list of additional links - beyond the main paper link that Manubot returns
# - that will show under your paper citation.

# type:
# Determines link icon and default text. Look in "/_includes/paper-links.html"
# to see what unique types can be specified.

# text:
# Text to show next to icon. If not specified, defaults to some text that
# matches type (see "type")

# link:
# Url to link to. If not specified, defaults to the url that Manubot returns for
# the citation.

    Along with collaborators at UCLA, we were able to detect a small, but significant amount of microbes in blood This is surprising since it's typically assumed that the immune system typically removes any microbial presence from human blood. I used a reference-free microbial community algorithm, called EMDeBruijn, to help corroborate the patterns we saw which included an increase in microbial diversity in schizophrenia patients. EMDeBruijn is a metric based on the Wasserstein metric (aka the Earth Mover's Distance) and a de Bruijn graph induced by the k-mers in a metagenomic DNA sample.

In this work, we develop the only (to date) method to assess the accuracy of so called "motif discovery algorithms" that seek to find important sub-networks of a given gene regulatory network. We develop a provably correct mathematical approach (based on a variety of metrics that say how close two matrices are to each other) and use this to assess the performance of a variety of motif discovery algorithms.

    This work improves upon the so called "min hash" technique (a "probabilistic data analysis" method) to develop a very fast and efficient way to estimate the similarity of two sets of objects (in terms of how much they overlap). The approach we present is orders of magnitude faster (and uses orders of magnitude less space) when two data sets under consideration are of very different size. The kinds of sets we consider are sets of sub-strings (called k-mers) of DNA sequences from communities of microorganisms.

    In this paper, we improve both the accuracy and speed of the Quikr approach to classifying a given set of metagenomic DNA sequences (16S rRNA). This is accomplished by increasing the number of "feature vectors" we use for each training genome, and by modifying the Lawson-Hanson algorithm for non-negative least squares.

    We demonstrate that a concept of "weighted information content" (known as topological pressure, from the ergodic theory literature) can be used to facilitate the analysis of genomic data (in particular, find areas of a genome that have many genes in them). This is a conceptual extension to topological entropy approach presented earlier.

    We prove that nonnegative least squares (typically prone to over-fitting) can be slightly modified to return sparse results.

    Extending the results of Quikr to whole genome shotgun metagenomic samples, we develop a method to automatically select a parameter that balances sparsity (how succinct the result is) with accuracy.

  descriptions: >
    We introduce an extremely fast, light-weight, "big data" algorithm to quickly answer the question of "which bacteria are present?" in a given sample of DNA. The method is based on the theory of compressed sensing and aims to find the simplest explanation for the data in terms of known information.

    I define a new notion of "randomness" (called topological pressure) suitable for use on sequences of symbols (words) of finite length. I show that this can be used to distinguish between biologically interesting sequences in the human genome.
