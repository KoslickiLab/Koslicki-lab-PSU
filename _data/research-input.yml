# NOTES:

# Using the research list component, papers will be displayed in order of and
# grouped by date, regardless of how they are listed here.

# Any property that Manubot returns can be manually overridden by putting it
# here, such as "date", "publisher", etc. Use the output file as a reference
# for the expected format (eg dates should be YYYY-MM-DD).

# If a paper is already in the output file (matched by id), that existing
# citation data will be used instead of calling Manubot again. To clear this
# "cache", remove that output entry, or simply delete the whole output file.

# PARAMETERS:

# id:
# An identifier string that Manubot can understand and cite. Also used to
# determine if a paper already exists in the output.

# image:
# Url to a striking image. Use a figure from your paper, or if there are none,
# use a journal logo or issue cover.

# tags:
# A list of key topics/themes of your paper. Aim for 2 to 5. look at other
# papers and try to use similar tags.

# repo:
# A GitHub repo to automatically fetch tags (aka "topics") from.

# extra-links:
# A list of additional links - beyond the main paper link that Manubot returns
# - that will show under your paper citation.

# type:
# Determines link icon and default text. Look in "/_includes/paper-links.html"
# to see what unique types can be specified.

# text:
# Text to show next to icon. If not specified, defaults to some text that
# matches type (see "type")

# link:
# Url to link to. If not specified, defaults to the url that Manubot returns for
# the citation.

  tags: 
    - metagenome 
    - taxonomic profile
  repo: CAMI-challenge/OPAL
  descriptions: We introduce a framework to compare tools utilized to determine what microbes are present in a sample, and at what relative abundance. This will help computational biologists design better tools to analyze communities of microorganisms (which affect nearly everything in existence!).

  tags:
    - k-mer
    - metagenome
  descriptions: In this paper, we improve both the accuracy and speed of the Quikr approach to classifying a given set of metagenomic DNA sequences (16S rRNA). This is accomplished by increasing the number of "feature vectors" we use for each training genome, and by modifying the Lawson-Hanson algorithm for non-negative least squares.

  tags:
    - network
    - motif
  descriptions: A gene regulatory network is basically a representation of how genes interact with each other. In this work, we develop the only (to date) method to assess the accuracy of so called "motif discovery algorithms" that seek to find important sub-networks of a given gene regulatory network. We develop a provably correct mathematical approach (based on a variety of metrics that say how close two matrices are to each other) and use this to assess the performance of a variety of motif discovery algorithms.
