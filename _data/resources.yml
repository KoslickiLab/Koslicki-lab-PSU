  link: https://github.com/dkoslicki/MetaPalette
  description: "MetaPalette is a k-mer based bacterial community reconstruction technique that utilizes sparsity promoting ideas from the field of compressed sensing to reconstruct the composition of a bacterial community. This method allows for strain-level abundance estimation, and can quantify the evolutionary distance between organisms in the sample and in the training database (thereby allowing for successful classification even with incomplete training data)."
