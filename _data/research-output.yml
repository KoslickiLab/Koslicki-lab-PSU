  descriptions: 'We show that the minimizer Jaccard estimator is biased and inconsistent,
    which means that the expected difference (i.e., the bias) between the estimator
    and the true value is not zero, even in the limit as the lengths of the sequences
    grow. We derive an analytical formula for the bias as a function of how the shared
    k-mers are laid out along the sequences. We show both theoretically and empirically
    that there are families of sequences where the bias can be substantial (e.g. the
    true Jaccard can be more than double the estimate). Finally, we demonstrate that
    this bias affects the accuracy of the widely used mashmap read mapping tool.

  descriptions: 'We demonstrate that a concept of "weighted information content" (known
    as topological pressure, from the ergodic theory literature) can be used to facilitate
    the analysis of genomic data (in particular, find areas of a genome that have
    many genes in them). This is a conceptual extension to topological entropy approach
    presented earlier.
