    assumed that the immune system typically removes any microbial presence from human
    blood. I used a reference-free microbial community algorithm, called EMDeBruijn,
    to help corroborate the patterns we saw which included an increase in microbial
    diversity in schizophrenia patients. EMDeBruijn is a metric based on the Wasserstein
    metric (aka the Earth Mover''s Distance) and a de Bruijn graph induced by the

  descriptions: 'We introduce an extremely fast, light-weight, "big data" algorithm
    to quickly answer the question of "which bacteria are present?" in a given sample
    of DNA. The method is based on the theory of compressed sensing and aims to find
    the simplest explanation for the data in terms of known information.

  descriptions: 'I define a new notion of "randomness" (called topological pressure)
    suitable for use on sequences of symbols (words) of finite length. I show that
    this can be used to distinguish between biologically interesting sequences in
    the human genome.
