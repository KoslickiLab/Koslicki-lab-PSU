[comment]: Fill out your description below 

 **My passion and main research area is the development
of efficient algorithms to extract insight from \*-omics data**. This
puts my research squarely at the intersection of biology, computer science, and mathematics. I am particularly interested in the entire arc of
developing a computational biology method: rigorous mathematical
justification of a method, implementing the method into a tool usable by
the community, applying the tool to pressing scientific problems, and
finally using the results to inform further development of computational
techniques.

I have spent the majority of my career developing such computational
techniques. During this time, I have predominantly worked on the
**analysis of metagenomic data**, **reference/alignment-free analysis**
of genomic data, **probabilitic data analysis**, and **knowledge representation and reasoning with graph databases.**

Current hobbies include [astrophotography](https://www.instagram.com/koslickid/), PC gaming, and finding fun regiounal cuisine recipes to make for my wife and daughter.
