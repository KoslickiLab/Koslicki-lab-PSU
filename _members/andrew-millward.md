[comment]: Fill out your description below 

I'm a Master's student in the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Integrated Undergraduate (IUG) program at the Pennsylvania State University. I first joined the Koslicki Lab in February of 2021 with goals of conducting research within the field of bioinformatics. Specifically, I am interested in developing computational metrics to aid in determining species abundances within samples which can be applied directly to the real world. I am currently working on a project which attempts to modify the EMDUniFrac metric to allow for sample averages to be more consistent with the real-world while still exhibiting similar runtime and clustering performance of past papers. 

Outside of my research, I enjoy several hobbies, including hiking, swimming, PC gaming, and watching movies with friends and family.
