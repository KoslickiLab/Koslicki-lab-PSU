I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics at Schreyer Honors College, Pennsylvania State University. I joined Koslicki Lab in May 2021. My area of interest is developing machine learning model using Neural Networks and NLP techniques. Currently, I am working under the guidance of Dr. Koslicki and Chunyu Ma using graphs of biomedical knowledge and deep learning models to explain drug predictions.
