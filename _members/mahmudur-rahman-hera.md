I am a PhD student at Pennsylvania State University, USA. I am currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science from the EECS School of Penn State. I am doing this training under Dr. David Koslicki in KoslickiLab. Our lab focuses on solving problems in biology using computational resources. In particular, KoslickiLab works in solving metagenomic problems.

Before becoming a PhD student, I used to be an Assistant Professor at the Department of CSE, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. After completing graduation from BUET in 2017, I joined CSE, BUET as a Lecturer the same year. In September 2020, I joined CSE, BUET as an Assistant Professor.
