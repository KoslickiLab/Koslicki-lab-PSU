[comment]: Fill out your description below 

I'm a Ph.D. student in the Binformatics and Genomics (BG) program at Penn State University (PSU) and I joined the Koslicki Lab in May 2020. My major interest is to develop and apply novel computational methodsa and machine learning strategies on  multi-omics data for better biomedical applications (e.g. precision medicine, AI health, and translational research). Currently, I'm working on developing computational methods for metagenomic analysis as well as exploring translational research based on large biomedical knowledge graphs.  

Prior to my Ph.D. study at PSU, I've been working as a bioinformatician in Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL) for 18 months. I received master's degree in Biostatistics from Washington University in St. Louis and bachelor's degree in Biology from Wuhan University. The mixture of statistics, biology, and bioinformatics inspired my career in the field of computational biology, which is the main story in the Koslicki Lab: you can find many funny stories to follow here.  

Outside the lab, I usually play basketball (amateur), go to gym (amateur), go hiking (rookie), bake (amateur), or enjoy myself with Steam or Switch (skillful). My wife is always my best teammate except for video games.
