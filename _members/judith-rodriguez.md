[comment]: Fill out your description below 




Since 2022, I have been part of the Koslicki Lab as a Ph.D. student of the Bionformatics and Genomics (BG) program at Penn State University (PSU). My research interests include applying my biological knowledge to develop computational methods to analyze high-throughput sequencing data. I also have an interest in teaching and I have received the Schreyer Graduate Teaching Certificate. I really enjoy mentoring and teaching to undergraduate students (especially on the Bioinformatics field). I hope to continue teaching and be part of the development of undergraduate/graduate programs that focus in Bioinformatics.

While majoring in Cellular Molecular Biology at Sistema Ana G. Mendez in Puerto Rico, I was introduce to the world of Bioinformatics. Later on, I graduated with a master's degree in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology from Saint Louis University.

Once upon a time, I was a choir kid, so I enjoy a good karaoke session now and then. I also enjoy arts and crafts, as well as, relaxing under a palm tree in the sun.
