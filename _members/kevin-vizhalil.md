[comment]: Fill out your description below 

I am a Master of Science student in the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) program at Penn State University (PSU) and joined the Koslicki Lab in March 2023. My academic focus is on computational biology, particularly genome assembly. Currently, I am working on a reference-guided approach for metagenome assembly, aiming to produce more accurate and contiguous genome assemblies while ensuring that performance remains competitive with cutting-edge assemblers in the field.

Prior to my time at PSU, I worked at Cisco. I worked on the cloud-native Broadband Network Gateway (CNBNG) feature on the ASR9000 series of routers, specifically focusing on supporting both PPPOE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) and IPOE (IP over Ethernet) protocols.

Away from the lab, I am passionate about chess and piano, and I also enjoy both playing and watching soccer, with Manchester City being my favorite team.
